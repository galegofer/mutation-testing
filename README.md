# Mutation Test Exercise

You need to take the PalidromeTest class (Java and Kotlin flavors available) and try to reach 100% coverage.

After it, you will need to increase the mutation score also to 100%.

#### Usage

``` mvn clean install ```

Then the report will be available at your /target/pit-reports/index.html folder in order to see your coverage and mutation score progress.
